Reading | [S1] The old lighthouse keeper had seen many storms in his thirty years on the rock, but nothing like this. The fog rolled in thick as wool, swallowing the beam of light before it could reach the churning waves below. Then he heard it, three short bells from the channel, where no ship should be at this hour. He grabbed his lantern and peered into the mist, his heart pounding. Something was out there, something that shouldn't exist.

Reading | [S1] Deep beneath the ocean's surface, where sunlight fades to perpetual twilight, extraordinary creatures have evolved in ways that defy imagination. Bioluminescent jellyfish pulse with ethereal blue light, while giant squid hunt in the crushing darkness. At depths of over two miles, the pressure is immense, enough to collapse a submarine, yet life persists.

Reading | [S1] The telegram arrived on a Tuesday morning in June, nineteen forty-three. Margaret's hands trembled as she tore open the envelope, dreading the words she knew might be inside. Her brother had shipped out to North Africa six months ago, and his letters had grown increasingly sparse.

Cartoon | [S1] After giving everything some more thought, I've decided it's in the best interest of humanity to acquire Nexus AI. (laughs) I've spoken with the CEO and he's on board. Well (laughs), at least that's the impression he gave initially.

Single (Disfluent) | [S1] ... explore how we can design, create interfaces that are not confusing, but at the same time can be powerful. Um, you know, I think, uh, in the, the famous, um, usability book, it's, uh, it's this, um, um, oh, geez, I'm, I'm blanking on the term, uh, uh, the, the rule about, um, uh, it's like the simplicity rule. I can't recall. Oh, cognitive load maybe.

Single (Disfluent) | [S1] Uh, complacency when the motivation isn't structured properly. Like for example, if you, if you're in the cor- if you work in the corporation for many years, a lot of corporate employees, they just, they're, they're aiming for that stock vesting and they're, they're doing just a sufficient job to, to, to reach that vesting and, and they don't, they're not performing any better than that. Um, and so I think, um, that showed me an important insight. Yeah.

Single (Disfluent) | [S1] We see the pattern of revelations, major shifts. I think Neptune in Pisces, which that transit has been happening all of 2021, and Neptune will remain in the sign of Pisces until March of 2029. So it's several years more of this transit. And what it brings is a lot of things, you know, the thing that I tend to emphasize is the profound dissolution or profound changes

Single (Disfluent) | [S1] I asked her, "Do you have like a phrase you use," and she mentioned she actually does. Like when things get tense, when there's like a moment, like if her, if her roommate is like venting about work drama or just like is stressed, and her, her roommate like deals with anxiety, I'm like, "Oh, this is probably how it feels to live with me." But, um, and like if, if, if things are rough, like she'll internally just like use this practice where she's like, like, "Not my problem, not mine to carry, not mine to handle, not mine to change." Like she'll sort of repeat that. So that's interesting.

Single (Disfluent) | [S1] If I examine the, the, if, if you examine the range of options, uh, beginning from, like, say, individual all the way, right? There will be some revenue stream, uh, there will be some purchase, there'll be some hardware profit margin for someone who creates a smart product, um, uh, there will be memberships, personal and business, uh, and then there'll be usage-based, right? So I still believe that that's kinda how, those are all the metrics. To your point, what is a membership? Up to now, folks

Single (Disfluent) | [S1] I think, if, if we can keep it under 25 points allowed, sure, our odds improve significantly. We wouldn't need to put up huge numbers ourselves, or at least that's the theory. And I should, I want to share some other stats which might be a bit outside our current discussion, but regarding this compared to 2018, the team's final four games that year, they managed 18 points total.

Singing | [S1] (singing) Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I see.

Conversation | [S1] Alright then. So, so 18 years you spent in that, uh, in that role, but alongside that in, in, was it while you were working that position in '93, you started doing some work with the network? [S2] Uh, yes. It was somewhere around '93. I, I, I played tennis pretty well, you know? I, I, I competed as a tennis player. And the, I got a chance to do some broadcasting over in Brisbane.

Conversation | [S1] ... that will provide the analytics component- [S2] Right. [S1] ... to ideally get you to adopt some of their other tools. And- [S2] (laughs) [S1] ... some of those features are valuable too. [S2] That's interesting. [S1] Mailchimp, I mean, that's campaign manage-, uh, not exactly campaign management, but messaging platforms. [S2] Uh-huh. [S1] The, the companies that are, you know,

Conversation | [S1] They were like, they were pumped for it, going wild for it, and it disappeared immediately. [S2] Yeah, I think it's about people understanding what's available first. Um... [S1] I think the finish on that one too was really nice. [S2] Yeah. [S1] I mean, that was pretty awesome. [S2] Have you seen those new editions?

Conversation | [S1] He was just practicing with them and they were on rotation. [S2] So that was probably in January. [S1] I think startup stereotypes, there is some like that, but some of them, I think they need to be changed. Like we don't all work twenty-hour days. [S2] No, they just need to, it's called not, it's based in Silicon Valley. [S1] Yeah. [S2] But the stereotypes would apply if they, it was called Techlife- [S1] Palo Alto. [S2] ... Cupertino or Mountain View, California.


Conversation | [S1] That's a nice overview. [S2] We were at the downtown cinema. [S1] By that, you mean the one in Riverside? [S2] Yeah. [S1] Yeah. So not exactly downtown. [S2] Not exactly downtown, yeah. [S1] I know a little bit about that area. [S2] (laughs) [S1] You know, Millbrook doesn't have a cinema. [S2] (laughs) It's the closest one for us. It's the closest. [S1] Yeah, that's true. [S2] The most nearby. [S1] Riverside is nearby. [S2] Riverside's close. [S1] That's fair. [S2] Support nearby. [S1] You can say, say Riverside, definitely. [S2] Well, yeah, fair enough.

Conversation | [S1] But they also, they also discovered, um, they also discovered like patterns in the desert, um, near Peru, like in the Atacama Desert. [S2] Yeah. [S1] Um, and like, it was like, of like perfectly, like, geo- geometric shapes. And they're like, "Yo, this is definitely not like formed by wind. This has to be artificial." [S2] Yeah, it's too precise.

Conversation | [S1] 'Cause I, yeah, there, there has to be a way that they can just make the, the system recognize that, no, you did not earn this- [S2] (laughs) [S1] ... on your own. You still have to go and complete one if you want it for your own- [S2] Right. [S1] ... like, profile. [S2] Right. Mm-hmm. [S1] So, yeah. [S2] Um, yeah. So let's actually move into multiplayer.

Conversation | [S1] Yeah. [S2] Yeah. TRS as a whole is just relaxed. [S1] But anyway, you know that Mirror app that launched and then got removed like a month later?  [S2] Mirror, what, like, to your future? [S1] Yeah. [S2] Oh. [S1] So basically, there was an app, there's a show coming out. [S2] This is a show. [S1] Coming, I don't know what it is. [S2] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [S1] Like 2026 or something. Basically, Marcus, have you heard about this? [S2] I'm sorry, I don't know. No, I don't have an, it's an app- [S1] Okay, so I'll explain. I'll explain. [S2] Yeah. [S1] For context. So there's this app that launched in terms of the show called Mirror.

Conversation | [S1] Jamie Patterson, right? [S2] No, I know where- [S1] I know where- [S2] ... Patterson works as well. I know where- [S1] I know- I know he used to work near- on this street, and this is a weird street. [S2] The only person who I don't know where they work, Jamie. But anyway, why are we even talking about who works where? [S1] It was a- it was- it was a really weird street name where Jamie worked. [S2] I- I drove past this street on my commute. [S1] No, you didn't. [S2] Yeah, I did. [S1] No, you drove past the street that my street is down the street of. [S2] Nice. There's, like, one street in Oakfield, I think I'll be able to find it, mate.
