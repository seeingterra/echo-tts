# CUDA-enabled requirements for Echo-TTS (Windows-friendly)
#
# Use this file if you have an NVIDIA GPU and want GPU acceleration.
# It installs torch / torchaudio from the official PyTorch CUDA 12.8 wheel
# index (cu128).
# Always cross-check with:
#   https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# and adjust the index URL as needed for your CUDA runtime.

# Package index configuration
#
# NOTE: pip applies index settings globally for the whole requirements file.
# We therefore use PyPI as the primary index (for most deps) and add the
# official PyTorch cu128 wheel index as an *extra* index.
