# CUDA-enabled requirements for Echo-TTS (Windows-friendly)
#
# Use this file if you have an NVIDIA GPU and want GPU acceleration.
# It pins torch / torchaudio to versions that should be compatible with
# CUDA 12.4 wheels from the official PyTorch index as of late 2025.
# Always cross-check with:
#   https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# and adjust the versions or index URL as needed for your CUDA runtime.

# 1) Install torch and torchaudio from the CUDA 12.4 wheel index
--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
torch
torchaudio

# 2) Reset to the default PyPI index for everything else
--index-url https://pypi.org/simple

# The remaining dependencies are device-agnostic and mirror requirements.txt
